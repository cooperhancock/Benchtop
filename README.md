# Benchtop

A random collection of code to try out different concepts.

## Featured Code

(These things should actually work and you should be able to run them)

#### Binary Search

Find BinarySearch.* files in AlgsAndDataStructures, where I tested BinarySearch runtime in 5 different languages. Results are in comments at the top of each file. (TL;DR rust is very fast)

#### Greedy Activities

greedy_activities.py takes a list of acivities and makes a schedule with the maximum number of activities using a greedy algorithm
